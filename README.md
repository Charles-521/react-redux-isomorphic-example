react + redux: an universal example
===================================

## Introduction

This is an isomorphic/universal example built with react and [`Redux`](https://github.com/gaearon/redux) which utilizes the same codebase on both server and browser to correctly handle multiple requests at one time.

This example was previously built with [alt](https://github.com/coodoo/react-alt-isomorphic-example) and now fully migrated to `redux`, you might as well compare the two and see the differences.

Feel free to [ask questions](https://github.com/coodoo/react-redux-isomorphic-example/issues) or send over pull requests.

## Redux-devtools built in

With [redux-devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools/) in place, you can undo/redo any changes, just like travelling in time, have fun with it!

## The case for redux

We love react and flux for it's smooth workflow and simpler mindset which makes app development a lot easier.

Redux further makes everything __10x__ easier by transforming `flux store` into pure functions, with no state stored inside, which solved a lot of `singleton` and `waiting` issues in other implementations, it also encourages a lot of best practices like `container component`, easy extension points and minimal API surface area.

Under the hood, redux is heavily based on `functional programming` principals to make those nice things happen, but don't let the functional aspect of redux scares you off, __`as a lib user, you don't really need to know about those inner workings and get started without problems`__.

That being said, it's quite an enjoyable and amazing experience to read through the codebase line by line and fully understand how things worked in a very different manner, it's truly an eye opener.

In short, if you could only pick up one new skill this summer (2015), `redux` should be on the top of your list (and a bit of functional programming taste won't hurt too :)


## Feature Highlights

There are already a bunch of isomorphic examples out there, what's special about this one?

- it showcased an different __client-side routing__ approach using normal flux `store` (see `routr.js`)

- it reuses all routing rules, callbacks and data-fetching logics on both client and server, no need to dupe them on the server and trying to keep both in sync in the future

- it's implementation is extremely simple and easy to understand

- it's based on [`redux v1.0.0-rc`](https://github.com/gaearon/redux/tree/breaking-changes-1.0)'s latest API

- Using latest `ES6 and ES7` syntaxes



## Goals for this example

- reuse same codebase on both browser and server without any modification

- must be able to handle multiple requests on the server at the same time without polluting each other's data stores

- the approach must be easily understandable and simple to develop and maintain

- applicable to both isomorphic or browser-only applications

## Why Isomorphic

- shorter time-to-first-page for better user experience

- deep linking for better usability (ie: bookmarks)

- SEO

## Pay attention to these

#### How client-side routing works

- __The whole routing implementation is cleanly separated from the view, wrapping everything in a `flux store` (as named `reducer` in redux), this offers an alternative option beside `react-router`__

- Have a look at `routr.js`, see how it shares the same routing rules and hanlders on both client and server.

- See `server.js` how it invoke `routr` callbacks from outside and hook into the redux dispatching process, and also how it knows when data fetching from async sources is done

- Trace how `http://localhost/2` works on both server and client, how parameters are processed, passed into the app and triggers data fetching

#### How container component works

In most redux applications `<Connector>` is the root container component that holds all child components, it's responsible for fetching application state from outside, stores it, monitor it's `change` event and triggers redraw.

There's a nice `select` function in `<Connector>` that you could use to cherry pick and monitor only those `reducers` you are interested, by doing so you avoided unnecessary redraw calls hence making the app more performant.

See how it works in `AppWrap.js`.

## How to run the example

```
$ npm install --global babel
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Of course it's necessary that you understand how `redux` works in general, having a look at [these examples](https://github.com/gaearon/redux/tree/breaking-changes-1.0/examples) would be a good start.

## Special thanks

Thanks [@gaearon](https://github.com/coodoo/react-redux-isomorphic-example/issues/9) for code review and pointing out misc. issues, which helped to make the data structure normalized and become truely immutable.
